# Jimmy's AddOns
This is a package containing Jimmy's current addons.

 - Download the git client here:  https://git-scm.com/downloads
 
 After installing git client:
  - go to wow install folder\_classic_\interface
	- delete the Addons folder.
 using the git client cd to the wow install folder\_classic_\interface, and run this command
 - git clone https://github.com/jimmyfromthefuture/AddOns
 
 This will re-create the "Addons" folder using my repo.
 
 Before launching wow open the git client, and cd into the wow isntall folder\_classic\interface\addons and run this command
  - git pull

This will pull the latest version I have published.


If anything happens and git isn't working, delete the Addons Folder and start over.


Here is a video showing the basics of git for this.
