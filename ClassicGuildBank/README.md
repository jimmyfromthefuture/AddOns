Classic Guild Bank Companion Addon for [classicguildbank.com](https://classicguildbank.com) website

### About
 
The classic guild bank companion addon lets you export inventory from your characters or bank alts to the [classicguildbank.com](https://classicguildbank.com) website.  This site is where the rest of your guild members can log in and see the items available in the guild bank.

### Getting Started
 
Getting started is simple, first download the addon here and install it. On the character you want to export inventory for, simply open your bank and type /cgb. The addon will generate a serialized data string which is then copied into the upload portion of the website.
Once uploaded the site will deserialize the string and the 'guild bank' will be updated with your characters newest data.
